# Paper Trading

Paper trading is the bridge between backtest and live money. You run your automated trading system in real-time with simulated capital, discovering bugs, biases, and operational nightmares before they cost real money.

The book: "Paper trading has a number of benefits; chief among them is that this is practically the only way to see if your ATS software has bugs without losing a lot of real money."

## Why It's Critical

Your backtest passed [[out-of-sample-testing]]. Parameters look robust. [[sharpe-ratio]] is excellent. You're ready to trade, right?

**Wrong.** The book emphasizes paper trading reveals issues backtests can't:

**1. Look-ahead bias detection:**
"Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy — there may just be no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before you enter an order!"

If your paper trades don't match backtest predictions on the same historical dates, you're using future data. The book calls this out explicitly as paper trading's killer feature.

**2. Software bugs:**
Backtest code ≠ execution code. Subtle bugs appear when transitioning from MATLAB/Excel simulation to API-driven live execution. Paper trading finds them before they cost money.

**3. Data issues:**
Can you actually download required data fast enough? Book's example: "It took me some 20 minutes to download and parse all my historical data each morning, and another 15 minutes to transmit all the orders." 

If your strategy needs data <35 minutes old at market open, you have a problem. Paper trading reveals this; backtesting doesn't.

**4. Operational workflow:**
Real-time reveals friction: order transmission delays, broker API failures, data feed drops, timing issues that backtests assume away.

**5. Transaction cost realism:**
Actual fill prices vs. assumed prices. Slippage in practice vs. model. The book: "Compare paper trades and P&L with theoretical ones generated by backtest... If difference is not due to transaction costs, your software likely has bugs."

## What to Validate

The book provides a validation checklist:

**Compare paper vs. backtest:**
- **Same positions?** If not → [[look-ahead-bias]] or software bug
- **Same entry prices?** If not → slippage model unrealistic
- **Same P&L?** After accounting for [[transaction-costs]], should match

**Operational readiness:**
- Can you download data before market open?
- Can you generate orders in time?
- Can you transmit orders reliably?
- Can you monitor positions intraday?

**Intuition building:**
The book notes: "Paper trading gives you better intuitive understanding of your strategy, including volatility of its P&L, typical amount of capital utilized, number of trades per day."

You theoretically know max drawdown from backtest. But experiencing a -5% day in paper trading **feels** different than seeing it in Excel. This psychological preparation matters.

## Duration

**Book's guidance:** "If you are able to run a paper trading system for a month or longer, you may even be able to discover data-snooping bias."

**Minimum:** 2-4 weeks for daily strategies

**Ideal:** 2-3 months to observe:
- Variety of market conditions
- Edge cases (volatile days, low volume days, holidays)
- Full distribution of P&L outcomes

For seasonal strategies: Must paper trade through at least one full season (e.g., April for gasoline futures).

For [[high-frequency-trading]]: Might need only days/weeks given thousands of trades generated.

## Common Failures

**Mismatch with backtest:**

Book: "Do the trades generated by your ATS match the ones generated by your backtest program? If difference is not due to transaction costs... your software likely has bugs."

Example failures:
- Backtest showed 50 trades on Jan 15; paper trading generated 30
- Backtest bought AAPL at $150; paper system didn't generate buy signal
- Backtest P&L: +$1,500; paper P&L: +$200 (after costs)

First two = bugs or [[look-ahead-bias]]. Third might be realistic costs.

**Data unavailability:**

Example from book: Strategy needs intraday volume to generate close-of-day signal. But volume data feed delayed by 15 minutes → can't execute at close → must wait until next day → different prices → strategy broken.

Fix: Either get real-time data feed, or adjust strategy to use previous day's volume.

**Timing failures:**

Book: "Do not underestimate the time required for preparing your orders before market opens."

Their 35-minute workflow (download + parse + transmit) meant strategies depending on <35-minute-old data failed in paper trading but looked great in backtest.

## Setting Up Paper Trading

**Broker requirements:**
Book mentions: "I mentioned names of some brokerages that offer paper trading accounts in Chapter 4."

Look for:
- Interactive Brokers (offers paper trading)
- TD Ameritrade (thinkorswim platform)
- TradeStation

Some brokers don't offer paper trading. In that case, manually track simulated positions in spreadsheet while running live order generation (but don't submit orders).

**System setup:**
1. **Automated order generation:** Your strategy code runs on schedule (pre-market, at close, intraday)
2. **Order transmission:** Either automatic (via API) or manual (copy-paste to broker)
3. **Position tracking:** Record fills, maintain position inventory
4. **P&L calculation:** Daily and cumulative
5. **Comparison log:** Track backtest predictions vs. actual results

## Attention Decay Problem

Book warning: "Traders usually pay less and less attention to performance of a paper trading system as time goes on, since there are always more pressing issues (such as real trading programs that are being run). This inattention causes paper trading system to perform poorly because of neglect and errors in operation."

**Solution:** Treat paper trading seriously. Set calendar reminders. Review daily. Maintain discipline as if real money were involved.

The book concludes: "Data-snooping bias can usually be discovered only when you have actually started trading the system with a small amount of capital."

Implication: If you can't maintain paper trading discipline, it's better to trade live with tiny capital ($5-10K) than paper trade carelessly.

## Transitioning to Live

**After successful paper trading:**
- Positions match backtest ✓
- P&L matches expectations after costs ✓
- No operational nightmares ✓
- Comfortable with volatility and drawdowns ✓

**Start live with small capital:**
Book's philosophy: Don't jump from $0 paper trading to full Kelly leverage. Start with 10-25% of intended capital:
- Test with real money (psychological different from paper)
- Verify broker execution quality
- Build confidence before scaling via [[kelly-formula]]

**Monitor live vs. paper:**
Keep paper trading running alongside live! Compare execution quality. Paper trades should still match backtest; live should match paper (within bid-ask spread).

If live underperforms paper → broker execution quality issue or hidden costs.

## Related Skills

Preparation:
- [[backtesting]] — What you're validating
- [[out-of-sample-testing]] — Previous validation step
- [[execution-systems]] — What you're testing

Detection:
- [[look-ahead-bias]] — Paper trading catches this immediately
- [[data-snooping-bias]] — Extended paper trading can reveal
- [[transaction-costs]] — Paper trading reveals true costs

Next steps:
- [[risk-management]] — After paper trading succeeds, size positions properly
- [[kelly-formula]] — But start with fractional Kelly initially

The book's bottom line: Paper trading is the final exam before risking capital. It's not optional. Budget weeks to months for this validation. The cost in time is trivial compared to the cost of discovering bugs or [[look-ahead-bias]] with real money.

And remember: Paper trading success doesn't guarantee live success (data-snooping bias can still exist), but paper trading failure **absolutely** guarantees live failure. Fix all paper trading issues before going live. No exceptions.
