# Quantitative Trading Skill Graph

This skill graph maps the essential knowledge for building your own algorithmic trading business. Whether you're a solo trader or managing capital, these interconnected skills form the foundation of systematic, profitable trading.

## Core Skill Areas

Building a quantitative trading operation requires mastering four interconnected domains: finding profitable strategies through [[strategy-research]], validating them rigorously via [[backtesting]], executing them reliably with [[execution-systems]], and protecting capital through disciplined [[risk-management]].

## Your Learning Path

If you're new to quantitative trading, start with [[strategy-research]] to understand where trading ideas come from and how to evaluate them. Then master [[backtesting]] to avoid the costly pitfalls that destroy most strategies before they go live.

Once your backtest looks solid, study [[execution-systems]] to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. Finally, internalize [[risk-management]] — because the difference between growing wealth and ruin often comes down to position sizing and emotional discipline.

## Key Insights

The book reveals a counter-intuitive truth: **capacity is the independent trader's advantage**. While billion-dollar funds struggle with [[high-frequency-trading]] and market impact, small traders can exploit inefficiencies with strategies that have low capacity but spectacular [[sharpe-ratio]] values.

Success requires both technical and psychological mastery. You must understand the mathematics of [[kelly-formula]] and [[optimal-leverage]], but also recognize the behavioral traps that cause traders to override their systems at the worst possible moments.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike discretionary trading, quantitative trading demands precision. A single [[look-ahead-bias]] in your backtest can make a losing strategy appear profitable. Understanding [[transaction-costs]] can mean the difference between a 4.0 Sharpe ratio and bankruptcy.

But with discipline and the right skills, independent traders consistently outperform institutions burdened by constraints, politics, and the need to deploy billions of dollars.

## Start Here

New to a specific concept? The skill graph uses four main Maps of Content (MOCs):

- **[[strategy-research]]** — Finding and evaluating trading ideas
- **[[backtesting]]** — Testing strategies without fooling yourself  
- **[[execution-systems]]** — Building reliable automated trading
- **[[risk-management]]** — Optimal leverage and capital protection

Each MOC links to detailed skills. Follow the [[wikilinks]] to explore connections and build your knowledge systematically.
