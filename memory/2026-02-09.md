## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Tailscale for Secure Remote Access

**Topic selected:** Tailscale VPN for remote homelab access

**Why this topic:**
- Natural progression from homelab stack (Caddy, Pi-hole, Ollama, RAG)
- Currently can only access Pi services from home network
- Remote access enables: Mission Control anywhere, Uptime Kuma monitoring on-the-go, SSH from anywhere
- Security-first: no open ports, WireGuard-based, zero-config NAT traversal

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Free tier is generous** — 3 users, 100 devices, all features including exit nodes
2. **Install is trivial** — 4 commands to get Pi on Tailscale
3. **Tailscale Serve** — Auto-HTTPS for Pi services, accessible from tailnet
4. **Subnet router** — Pi becomes gateway to entire 192.168.0.x network
5. **Pi-hole integration** — DNS filtering works everywhere via Tailscale

**Practical applications:**
- Access Mission Control from phone while traveling
- Monitor Uptime Kuma alerts remotely
- SSH into Pi without port forwarding
- Pi-hole ad-blocking on cellular

**Quick start:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/debian/bookworm.noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/debian/bookworm.tailscale-keyring.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install tailscale
sudo tailscale up
```
