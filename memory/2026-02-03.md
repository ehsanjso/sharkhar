## 12:00 - Spare Capacity Research
- Ran spare capacity cron job
- Quotas all healthy (<30% used)
- Did AI news research, captured to research/2026-02-03-ai-news-digest.md
- Key findings: Claude Code outage, Anthropic Cowork plugins, GPT-4o retirement, Nvidia-OpenAI deal on ice

## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Home Assistant + AI Integration

**Topic selected:** Home Assistant AI conversation agents and smart home control

**Why this topic:**
- Ehsan has homeassistant skill installed but hasn't explored AI integration
- Ties into self-hosted infrastructure goals (Pi-hole, Uptime Kuma, Mission Control)
- Multiple integration paths: HA native AI agents + ClawdBot skill
- Natural evolution from MCP research (Feb 2)

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Native AI support** — HA supports Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Ollama as conversation agents
2. **Device control** — AI can turn on/off lights, adjust climate, trigger scenes
3. **Entity exposure** — Security model lets you choose which devices AI can access
4. **Voice hardware** — $13-$59 options for wake-word-triggered voice assistants
5. **AI personalities** — Can make Claude respond as Super Mario or custom character
6. **ClawdBot integration** — homeassistant skill provides API access for text/automation
7. **Best of both** — Use HA AI for voice, ClawdBot skill for text/cron automation

**Practical applications:**
- Set up Claude conversation agent in HA for voice control
- Configure ClawdBot homeassistant skill with HA_TOKEN
- Create morning/evening automations via cron → HA scenes
- Camera + AI vision for doorbell notifications
- Add HA widget to Mission Control dashboard

## 06:00 PM — Spare Capacity: Code Improvements

**Quotas:** Session 3%, Weekly 25%, Sonnet 7% (all healthy)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed polymarket-bot code for improvements
- Enhanced scanner.py with better error handling:
  - Added 30s request timeout (was infinite)
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries)
  - Replaced bare `except:` with specific exception types
  - Added proper logging throughout
  - Graceful handling of empty API responses

**Commit:** `c8b9e512` - fix(polymarket): improve scanner error handling
