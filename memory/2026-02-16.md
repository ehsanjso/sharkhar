## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Market Microstructure & Regime Detection

**Topic selected:** Market Microstructure & Regime Detection for Prediction Markets

**Why this topic:**
- Polymarket V2 bot just deployed yesterday with "anti-retail" strategies
- Regime Detection was the ONLY profitable V1 strategy (2W/1L)
- $9,600 paper trading now active across 6 markets
- Need to understand WHY mean reversion dominates before deciding which strategies to fund

**Critical discovery from 72M trades analysis:**
- **Takers lose -1.12% on average, Makers earn +1.12%**
- Only 12.7% of wallets profitable (matches prior research)
- "Optimism Tax" - retail bets YES on longshots, pros fade it
- V1 strategies were TAKERS (betting WITH momentum) → explains losses
- V2 strategies behave more like MAKERS (fading retail flow) → correct approach

**Why Regime Detection works:**
- Uses Hidden Markov Models to detect market "mood"
- Different strategies for different regimes (volatility states)
- Only bets when confident about regime (>70% probability)
- Academic study showed: 50% lower volatility, 52% better Sharpe ratio

**Practical takeaways for V2:**
1. Regime Detection is scientifically sound - keep it funded
2. "Fade the Move" is textbook market-making - keep it
3. Consider adding HMM regime indicator to dashboard
4. Track which strategies win in which regime
5. Polymarket has Maker Rebates Program - could offset losses
