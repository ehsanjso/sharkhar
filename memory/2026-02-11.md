## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Prometheus + Grafana for Pi Monitoring

**Topic selected:** Prometheus + Grafana observability stack for Raspberry Pi 5

**Why this topic:**
- Discovered 84°C throttling via pi-health.sh, but only point-in-time visibility
- Uptime Kuma does availability (up/down), not performance over time
- Need to answer: "When does throttling happen? What triggers it? How often?"
- Completes the observability triad: availability + performance + trends

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Low resource usage** — Full stack uses ~200-400MB RAM on Pi 5
2. **hwmon collector** — node_exporter exposes Pi thermal sensor as Prometheus metric
3. **Dashboard 1860** — "Node Exporter Full" gives instant comprehensive view
4. **Install time** — ~30 minutes from zero to beautiful dashboards
5. **PromQL power** — Can correlate temp vs CPU frequency vs time of day

**Tech stack:**
```
node_exporter (9100) → Prometheus (9090) → Grafana (3000)
     15MB                 100-200MB          50-100MB
```

**Practical applications:**
- Thermal pattern discovery (when/why does Pi throttle?)
- Capacity planning (memory/disk trends over weeks)
- Alerts before problems (notify when temp > 80°C for 5 min)
- Correlate events (what was happening when X got slow?)

**Integration opportunities:**
- Add `grafana.home` to Caddy reverse proxy
- Access dashboards remotely via Tailscale
- Embed Grafana panels in Mission Control's /agent page
