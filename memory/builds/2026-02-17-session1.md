# 🤖 Proactive Coder - Session 1

**Date:** Monday, Feb 17, 2026 - 7:00 PM  
**Duration:** ~25 min  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📋 Task Selected

**Create `cron-audit.sh`** - A diagnostic tool to analyze cron jobs for cost optimization.

### Why This Task
- Backlog showed skill audit was complete
- Auto-compaction script done but noted "use Haiku for cost savings"
- Found 16 cron jobs: 11 on expensive default model, only 5 on Haiku
- Clear opportunity to visualize and optimize

---

## 🔧 What Was Built

### `scripts/cron-audit.sh`

New diagnostic script that:
1. **Lists all cron jobs** with color-coded model indicator
2. **Shows summary stats** (total, enabled, by model)
3. **Suggests optimizations** based on job name patterns
4. **Calculates potential savings** (Haiku is ~10x cheaper than Sonnet)

### Features
- `--expensive` - Focus only on high-cost jobs
- `--suggest` - Show per-job recommendations
- `--summary` - Quick stats only
- `--json` - Machine-readable output for scripts

### Example Output
```
🔍 Cron Job Audit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Summary
  Total jobs:     16
  Enabled:        14
  Using Haiku:    5 (cheap)
  Using Default:  11 (expensive)

💡 Optimization Potential
  Switching 11 jobs from Default→Haiku could save ~99x API costs
```

## 📊 Findings

| Job Name | Current Model | Suggestion |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Proactive Coder | default | Keep (complex) |
| Daily Research | default | Keep (complex) |
| Pill Reminder | default | **Use Haiku** |
| Spare Capacity | default | Review |
| Polymarket Reports | default | Review |

**Quick Win:** Pill Reminder is a simple notification - should be Haiku.

## ✅ Commits

```
feat(scripts): add cron-audit.sh for analyzing cron job costs

- Shows all cron jobs with model and schedule
- Color-coded by model (green=haiku, yellow=default)
- Suggests which jobs could use cheaper Haiku model
- Supports --expensive, --suggest, --summary, --json flags
- Updates README.md with documentation
```

---

## 📝 Notes for Session 2

### Follow-up Tasks
1. **Actually optimize some cron jobs** - Use the audit to switch appropriate jobs to Haiku
2. **Add weekly runs estimate** - Calculate cost based on schedule frequency
3. **Consider auto-suggest mode** - Script could auto-generate `clawdbot cron update` commands

### Cron jobs that should probably use Haiku:
- `Pill Reminder` (simple notification)
- `Morning Brief` (already on Haiku ✓)
- `Claude Quota Monitor` (already on Haiku ✓)
- `NFT Price Monitor` (already on Haiku ✓)

### Jobs that need expensive models:
- `Proactive Coder` sessions (complex coding tasks)
- `Daily Research Report` (needs reasoning)
- `Investor Digest` (needs analysis)
