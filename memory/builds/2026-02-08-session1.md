# Proactive Coder - Session 1 (Feb 8, 2026)

**Started:** 7:00 PM  
**Model:** Sonnet (cron job)

## Task Selection

Scanned workspace and memory files for improvement opportunities:
- Scripts in good shape (reviewed earlier today)
- `memory_search` tool disabled due to missing API keys
- Feb 8 research identified RAG as priority, but Ollama + LanceDB not installed yet
- 11 memory files, growing — need search capability

**Selected:** Create `memory-search.sh` — simple grep-based search as stopgap

## Work Completed

### Created: scripts/memory-search.sh ✅
Fast grep-based search for all memory files while waiting for RAG setup.

**Features:**
- Searches `memory/*.md`, `memory/**/*.md`, and `MEMORY.md`
- Case-insensitive by default
- `--word` flag for whole-word matching (avoids "storage" matching "rag")
- `--context N` for surrounding lines (default: 2)
- `--files-only` for quick file listing
- `--json` output for automation
- Color-coded output with highlighted matches

**Usage examples:**
```bash
./memory-search.sh "quota"                 # Search with context
./memory-search.sh "rag" --word            # Whole words only
./memory-search.sh "ollama" --files-only   # Just filenames
./memory-search.sh "api" --json            # JSON output
```

### Updated: scripts/README.md ✅
Added documentation for memory-search.sh

## Testing

All modes tested and working:
- Default context search ✓
- Files-only mode ✓
- Word boundary mode ✓
- JSON output ✓

## Time Spent

~15 minutes (well under 45 min limit)

## For Session 2

Potential follow-ups:
1. Add `--recent N` flag to only search last N days
2. Add file type filtering (daily vs research vs builds)
3. Begin RAG setup: install Ollama + nomic-embed-text
4. Create LanceDB indexer script

## Commit

```
feat(scripts): add memory-search.sh for grep-based memory file search

Stopgap until RAG/semantic search is set up. Supports:
- Case-insensitive search with context
- --word flag for whole-word matching
- --files-only for quick file listing
- --json output for automation
```
