# Proactive Coder - Session 1 (Planning & Setup)
**Date:** 2026-02-03 7:00 PM  
**Time Limit:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Plan + Setup + Initial Implementation

---

## Improvement Target

### Add Service Health to Agent Dashboard

**Why this matters:**
- Agent Dashboard shows quota, crons, and commits
- Missing: Actual service health (are services UP or DOWN?)
- Uptime Kuma monitors 9 services - this data should be on the dashboard
- Improves context recovery when I wake up each session

**Current state:**
- Uptime Kuma running at http://192.168.0.217:3001
- Python script `skills/uptime-kuma/scripts/kuma.py` works
- Agent Dashboard at `/agent` has good structure
- Missing integration between them

**Deliverables:**
1. `/api/service-health` endpoint in Mission Control
2. "Services" card on Agent Dashboard
3. Shows all monitors with UP/DOWN status

---

## Plan (Ralph Wiggum Style)

### Step 1: Create API endpoint ✅
- Add `/api/service-health/route.ts`
- Call kuma.py to get monitor status
- Return JSON with simplified monitor data

### Step 2: Add Services card to Agent Dashboard
- New card showing service health
- Color-coded status (green/red)
- Show last checked time

### Step 3: Test & Polish
- Verify it works
- Handle errors gracefully
- Commit with clear message

## Implementation Progress

### API Endpoint Created
`/home/ehsanjso/clawd/mission-control/src/app/api/service-health/route.ts`

Features:
- Executes kuma.py with JSON output
- Parses response and simplifies to essential fields
- Returns: `{ services: [...], lastChecked, allUp, upCount, downCount }`
- Error handling for script failures

---

## Session 2 Instructions

**Continue from:** Update the Agent Dashboard page.tsx to add Services card

**What's ready:**
- API endpoint at `/api/service-health` is complete
- Returns simplified service status data
- Test with: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/service-health`

**What's left:**
1. Import service health in page.tsx
2. Add state for services
3. Create Services card component
4. Wire up the fetch

**UI Design:**
- Card header: "Services" with Server icon
- List services with colored dots (green=up, red=down)
- Footer: "X of Y services up" summary
- Link to Uptime Kuma for details
