# Proactive Coder - Session 2 (Verification & Documentation)
**Date:** 2026-02-03 11:00 PM  
**Time Limit:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Continue Session 1's work

---

## Session Status

**Session 1 completed the MVP early!** 

The service health feature is fully functional:
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/service-health` returns all 9 monitors
- ✅ Dashboard card shows status with color-coded dots
- ✅ "All systems operational" indicator working
- ✅ Link to Uptime Kuma for details
- ✅ Committed as `7cd45960`

---

## Verification Tests

### API Test
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/service-health | jq .
```
**Result:** Returns 9 services, all showing `"status": "up"`, `"allUp": true`

### Visual Test
- Dashboard at http://192.168.0.217:3000/agent loads correctly
- Services card displays all monitors
- Green dots for up services

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These would be nice-to-have but not urgent:

1. **Response time metrics** - kuma.py has `heartbeats` command that could fetch per-monitor latency
2. **Expanded service details** - Click to see hostname/URL
3. **Status change notifications** - Alert when a service goes down

---

## Summary

Session 2 verified Session 1's completed work. No additional coding needed - the feature is production-ready.

**Feature delivered:** Service Health card on Agent Dashboard
- Shows real-time status of all 9 monitored services
- Integrates with existing Uptime Kuma infrastructure
- Improves visibility when I wake up each session

**Time spent:** ~10 minutes (verification only)
