# Proactive Coder Build — 2026-01-30 (Thursday Night)

## Summary

Tonight's session followed the Ralph Wiggum approach: small, iterative steps. Four commits made!

## Commits

1. **Add systemd service file for Mission Control**
   - Created `mission-control/mission-control.service`
   - Enables persistent running of the dashboard

2. **Add install script for Mission Control systemd service**  
   - Created `mission-control/install-service.sh`
   - Run with `sudo ./install-service.sh` to enable auto-start

3. **Update task board: mark systemd service and Remotion ARM test as done**
   - Updated tasks page to reflect tonight's completed work

4. **Document ARM64/Pi5 support in Remotion README**
   - Confirmed Remotion renders work on Raspberry Pi 5
   - Test render: 3-second video rendered successfully (204.8 KB)

## Verified Working

- ✅ **Mission Control** builds successfully on Pi
- ✅ **Remotion** renders video on ARM64 (linux-arm64 chrome-headless-shell)
- ✅ **ffmpeg** is installed and ready for video scripts

## Test Render Output

```
~/clawd/remotion-videos/out/TextTitle_20260130_011616.mp4 (200K)
```

Render took ~30 seconds for 90 frames on Pi 5.

## What's Next

- [ ] Ehsan to run `sudo ./install-service.sh` in mission-control to enable auto-start
- [ ] Add API keys to Last30Days skill for better research
- [ ] Consider more video templates for Remotion

## Files Changed

- `mission-control/mission-control.service` (new)
- `mission-control/install-service.sh` (new)
- `mission-control/src/app/tasks/page.tsx` (updated)
- `remotion-videos/README.md` (updated)
