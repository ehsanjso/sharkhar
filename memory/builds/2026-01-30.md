# Nightly Build — 2026-01-30 (01:14 AM)

## Summary

First proactive coder session! Followed the Ralph Wiggum approach — small steps, one at a time.

## Task Completed

**Mission Control systemd service** — Make the dashboard run persistently.

## Steps Taken

1. ✅ Added `output: 'standalone'` to `next.config.ts`
2. ✅ Built production version (`npm run build`)
3. ✅ Copied static assets to standalone folder
4. ✅ Created `mission-control.service` systemd unit file
5. ✅ Created `setup-service.sh` installation script
6. ✅ Tested standalone server (starts in 88ms!)
7. ✅ Updated daily journal

## Commits

```
d776997 Add standalone output to next.config for production deployment
5b65533 Add systemd service file for Mission Control
cd64c56 Add setup script for systemd service installation
```

## Ready for Review

Ehsan needs to run:
```bash
cd ~/clawd/mission-control
sudo ./setup-service.sh
```

This will install Mission Control as a background service that:
- Starts automatically on boot
- Restarts on failure
- Runs on port 3000
- Limited to 512MB memory (Pi-friendly)

## What's Next

Other tasks from the TODO list:
- Add API keys to Last30Days
- Test Remotion renders on ARM
- Consider new features: Competitor Scan, Email Management
