# 🤖 Proactive Coder - Session 1

**Date:** Friday, Feb 13, 2026 - 7:00 PM  
**Duration:** 45 min limit  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📋 Task Selected

**Skill Description Audit** (from backlog.md #1)

**Goal:** Add "When to Use / When NOT to Use" blocks to skill descriptions to improve routing accuracy by ~20% (per OpenAI best practices).

**Why this task:**
- High-impact: Better skill routing = fewer wrong-tool calls
- Small increments: Each skill is independent
- Backlog item: Already planned, just needs execution
- No external dependencies (gateway timeout doesn't block this)

---

## 🎯 Session 1 Scope

Audit 3 skills with overlapping domains:

| Skill | Domain | Overlaps With |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| homeassistant | Smart home control | pi-admin (both involve device control) |
| jq | JSON processing | General shell scripting |
| process-watch | Process monitoring | pi-admin, sysadmin-toolbox |

**Template to add:**
```markdown
## When to Use
- [specific trigger scenarios]

## When NOT to Use
- [negative examples - what should trigger a DIFFERENT skill]
```

## ✅ Work Log

### 7:00 PM - Planning Complete
- Read MEMORY.md and backlog.md
- Selected skill audit task
- Identified 3 skills with overlapping domains
- Created this session plan

### 7:05 PM - Skill 1: homeassistant ✅
- Added When to Use: smart home control, lights, switches, scenes, entity states
- Added When NOT to Use: pi-admin for sysadmin, process-watch for monitoring

### 7:07 PM - Skill 2: jq ✅
- Added When to Use: JSON extraction, filtering, transformation, shell pipelines
- Added When NOT to Use: CSV→csvkit/mlr, XML→xmllint/xq, YAML→yq, interactive→fx/jless

### 7:09 PM - Skill 3: process-watch ✅
- Added When to Use: CPU/mem hogs, port investigation, kill processes, real-time monitoring
- Added When NOT to Use: pi-admin for services/updates, sysadmin-toolbox for tool discovery

### 7:11 PM - Commit & Wrap ✅
- Committed all 3 skill changes: `401b728e`
- Updated backlog.md with completion status
- Session 2 handoff notes written

## 🔮 Session 2 Handoff

**What's left:**
- Remaining skills: pi-admin, plan-my-day, pm2, sysadmin-toolbox (refs only?), tldr, tmdb
- Skills with external service deps: bambu-cli, gifgrep, playwright-cli, simple-backup

**Priority for Session 2:**
1. pi-admin (overlaps with process-watch - ensure consistency)
2. pm2 (overlaps with process management)
3. tldr (utility skill)

## 📝 Summary for Ehsan

**What I did:**
- Audited 3 skills with "When to Use / When NOT to Use" blocks
- homeassistant, jq, process-watch all now have clear routing guidance
- Updated backlog with remaining skills

**Commit:** `401b728e` - docs(skills): add When to Use/NOT to Use blocks

**Why it matters:**
- Better skill routing = fewer wrong-tool calls
- OpenAI research shows ~20% improvement in accuracy with negative examples
- Clear differentiation between overlapping skills (process-watch vs pi-admin vs sysadmin-toolbox)

**For Session 2:**
- Continue with pi-admin, pm2, tldr (9 skills remaining in backlog)
