## Session 2 Task: Cleanup Old Bloated Backups

Since Session 1 completed early, Session 2 picked up a follow-up task:
**Clean up pre-optimization bloated backups to reclaim disk space**

### Before Cleanup
```
576M  ~/backups/clawdbot/
├── clawdbot-2026-01-30_0924.tar.gz  (58MB, bloated)
├── clawdbot-2026-01-31_0300.tar.gz  (152MB, bloated)
├── clawdbot-2026-02-01_0300.tar.gz  (166MB, bloated)
├── clawdbot-2026-02-02_0300.tar.gz  (189MB, bloated)
└── clawdbot-2026-02-02_1901.tar.gz  (13MB, lean) ✅
```

### After Cleanup
```
13M   ~/backups/clawdbot/
└── clawdbot-2026-02-02_1901.tar.gz  (13MB, lean) ✅
```

### Space Reclaimed
- **Deleted:** 563MB of bloated backups
- **Kept:** 13MB lean backup with all essentials

### Verified Backup Contents
All critical data still present:
- ✅ agents/ (session logs)
- ✅ clawdbot.json (main config)
- ✅ credentials/ (auth tokens)
- ✅ cron/ (job configs)
- ✅ devices/ (paired devices)
- ✅ identity/
- ✅ telegram/
- ✅ subagents/

## Results

### ✅ Session 1 + Session 2 Combined Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Single backup size | 189MB | 13MB | 93% smaller |
| Backup folder size | 576MB | 13MB | 98% smaller |
| Weekly storage (7-day) | ~1.3GB | ~90MB | 93% savings |

### Total Space Reclaimed Today
- Session 1: Prevented future bloat (ongoing savings)
- Session 2: Reclaimed 563MB immediately

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Both sessions successful

### Nothing Remaining
- Backup optimization: Done
- Old backup cleanup: Done
- All changes committed: Yes (Session 1)
- Documentation: Updated

---

## Future Ideas (Not Urgent)

1. Add ~/clawd/ workspace to backup rotation?
2. Backup integrity check (periodic verification)
3. Off-site backup sync (rclone to cloud?)

**Session 2 Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Start:** 11:00 PM
**End:** 11:05 PM
