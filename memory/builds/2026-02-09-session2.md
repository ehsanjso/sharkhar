# Proactive Coder - Session 2 (Feb 9, 2026)

**Started:** 11:00 PM  
**Model:** Opus (cron job)

## Mission

Continue from Session 1's devlog.sh implementation and add the planned improvements.

## Work Completed ✅

### 1. Added --yesterday (-y) flag
- Appends notes to yesterday's file instead of today
- Works with --list to view yesterday's entries
- Useful for late-night work you forgot to log

### 2. Added --edit (-e) flag  
- Opens target file in $EDITOR (defaults to nano)
- Combines with -y for editing yesterday's file
- Creates file with header if it doesn't exist

### 3. Created bash tab completion
- New file: `scripts/devlog-completion.bash`
- Completes options (-s, --section, -d, --dry-run, etc.)
- Completes common section names after --section (Debug, Work, Tasks, Ideas, Notes, Research, Build)

### 4. Added devlog alias
- Added to ~/.bashrc: `alias devlog='~/clawd/scripts/devlog.sh'`
- Sources completion file automatically
- Now can use `devlog "note"` from anywhere

### 5. Updated documentation
- Updated scripts/README.md with new features
- Added examples for new flags
- Noted alias and tab completion availability

## Commit

```
b67ac0c0 feat(devlog): add --yesterday, --edit flags and bash completion
```

## Tests Performed

```bash
./devlog.sh --help                          # ✓ Shows new options
./devlog.sh --yesterday --dry-run "test"    # ✓ Targets 2026-02-08.md
./devlog.sh -y --list                       # ✓ Shows yesterday's entries
./devlog.sh --section "Session 2 Build" "message"  # ✓ Works
```

## Time Spent

~5 minutes (well under 45 min limit)

## What's Next (Future sessions)

Session 1 + 2 completed all planned devlog.sh features. Future improvements:
1. **Add --date flag** - target any arbitrary date
2. **Add --search flag** - quick grep within current file
3. **Add --append-to-section flag** - append to existing section header
4. **Weekly summary generator** - summarize week's entries

## Notes

- No git remote configured, work committed locally
- All features working, tested, documented
- devlog.sh is now a fully-featured daily logging tool
