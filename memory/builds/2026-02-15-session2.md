## 📊 Commits Made

1. `4ba1b08f` — feat(skills): add artifacts output convention and audit skill routing
2. `7a0d3556` — feat(skills): complete skill routing audit

---

## 🔧 Still TODO

### From Session 1 Suggestions (Partially Done)
- [x] Update skills to use artifacts/ ✅
- [ ] Add prune-artifacts to cron (blocked by tool timeout)
- [ ] Continue skill audit → **COMPLETED!**

### Remaining from Backlog
1. **Templates task** — Add templates to task-tracker, frontend-design
2. **Auto-compaction cron** — Summarize old memory files weekly
3. **Security audit** — Document skills with network access

---

## 📈 Impact

- **Skill routing accuracy** — All skills now have "When to Use/NOT to Use" sections per OpenAI best practices
- **Output convention** — Two key skills now document artifacts/ as output location
- **Backlog cleared** — Major backlog item #1 (Skill Audit) is 100% complete

---

## 🚨 Issues Found

- **Cron tool timeout** — Gateway timeouts when listing/adding cron jobs
- Workaround: Manually add to cron via shell, or investigate gateway health

---

## Notes

The skill audit is now complete! This was the largest backlog item. All skills in ~/clawd/skills/ now have proper routing guidance following OpenAI's recommended pattern of including negative examples.

Next session can focus on:
1. Templates task (add to task-tracker, frontend-design)
2. Auto-compaction cron job
3. Investigate cron tool gateway timeout
