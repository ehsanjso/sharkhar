# Proactive Coder - Session 1 (Feb 6, 2026)

**Started:** 7:00 PM
**Model:** Sonnet
**Focus:** Memory maintenance visibility

## Task Selection

**Reviewed:**
- MEMORY.md — memory maintenance is manual, "every 3+ days" guideline
- Scripts — backup, prune, pi-health all have consistent patterns
- Memory folder — 33 files, 212KB, well organized but no stats tool

**Selected Task:** Create `memory-stats.sh`

**Why this task:**
1. Memory maintenance is mentioned but has no visibility tooling
2. Complements existing scripts (backup, prune, pi-health)
3. Small, focused, testable (~100 lines)
4. Follows Ralph Wiggum approach — one small thing

## Design

### memory-stats.sh

**Purpose:** Quick overview of memory folder health + maintenance status

**Features:**
- [ ] Total file/folder count and size
- [ ] Daily journal stats (count, oldest, newest)
- [ ] Research archive stats
- [ ] Builds archive stats  
- [ ] Last memory review detection (from daily files or MEMORY.md)
- [ ] Days since last review warning
- [ ] `--json` output for scripting

**Consistent with other scripts:**
- `--help` shows usage
- `--json` for machine-readable output
- Color-coded status indicators
- No external dependencies (pure bash)

## Session 1 Progress

### Completed
- [x] Analyzed memory folder structure
- [x] Reviewed existing script patterns
