# Proactive Coder - Session 1 (Feb 9, 2026)

**Started:** 7:00 PM  
**Model:** Opus (cron job)

## Assessment

**Scanned:**
- Scripts in ~/clawd/scripts/ — all well-maintained
- Memory system — working, 11 daily files, archiving works
- Build session logs — 18 files, good history
- Recent commits — active development, conventional commits

**What's working well:**
- memory-search.sh enhanced (--recent, --type flags)
- memory-stats.sh has working --cleanup flag
- pi-health.sh detects thermal throttling
- status.sh combines everything nicely
- Quota optimization is implemented

## Improvement Target

### Create `devlog.sh` - Quick CLI for Daily Notes

**Why this:**
- Currently no quick way to append notes to daily memory files
- Developers often want to jot things down without opening editors
- Fits the "capture everything" philosophy from AGENTS.md
- Small, self-contained, immediately useful

**Features planned:**
1. Append timestamped note to today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Create the file if it doesn't exist
3. Support multi-line input (stdin)
4. Optional section header (e.g., `--section "Work Log"`)
5. Preview what will be written (`--dry-run`)

**Usage examples:**
```bash
./devlog.sh "Fixed the API timeout issue"
./devlog.sh --section "Debug" "Traced bug to line 42"
echo "Long note" | ./devlog.sh
./devlog.sh --dry-run "Test entry"
```

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Create plan (this file)
2. ✅ Write basic script with timestamped append
3. ✅ Add --section flag
4. ✅ Add --dry-run flag
5. ✅ Add stdin support
6. ✅ Test all modes
7. ✅ Update scripts/README.md
8. ✅ Commit with conventional message

**STATUS: COMPLETE** ✅

## Work Log

### 7:00 PM - Assessment
- Scanned scripts directory, memory system, recent builds
- Identified devlog.sh as small, high-impact improvement
- Created this plan file

### 7:02 PM - Implementation Complete
- Created devlog.sh with all features:
  - Timestamped entries (bold formatting)
  - --section flag for section headers
  - --dry-run for preview
  - --list to view today's entries
  - stdin/pipe support
  - Auto-creates file with header
- Tested all modes successfully
- Updated scripts/README.md with documentation
- Committed: `feat(scripts): add devlog.sh for quick daily memory logging`

## Time Spent

~7 minutes (well under 45 min limit)

## Future Ideas (For Session 2)

1. **Add --yesterday flag** - append to yesterday's file
2. **Add --edit flag** - open today's file in $EDITOR
3. **Add tab completion** - for section names
4. **Create devlog alias** - add to ~/.bashrc
