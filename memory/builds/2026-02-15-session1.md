## 📋 Task: Artifacts Directory Convention

**From backlog item #2**

**Goal:** Standardize output location for generated files

---

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. Created Artifacts Directory Structure
- `~/clawd/artifacts/` - new directory for temporary outputs
- `artifacts/README.md` - conventions and guidelines
- `artifacts/.gitkeep` - keep dir in git

### 2. Updated .gitignore
- Added `artifacts/*` exclusion
- Protected `README.md` and `.gitkeep`

### 3. Created Cleanup Script
- `scripts/prune-artifacts.sh` - delete files older than N days
- Supports dry-run mode (default)
- Configurable age threshold (default: 7 days)
- Tested successfully - found 1 old file (2.1M)

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Added prune-artifacts.sh to scripts/README.md
- Updated backlog.md (marked item #2 complete)

### 5. Cleaned Existing Clutter
- Moved `adflow---ai-design-research.zip` from repo root to artifacts/
