# Proactive Coder - Session 1 (Feb 7, 2026)

## Session Info
- **Start:** 7:00 PM EST
- **Model:** Sonnet (cron)
- **Time limit:** 45 minutes
- **Goal:** Planning & Setup

## Problem Identified

**Target: memory-stats.sh enhancements**

Current issues with memory folder management:
1. Daily files accumulate (currently 10 files from Jan 30 - Feb 7)
2. No recommendations for cleanup or archival
3. No detection of duplicate/redundant research topics
4. No size warnings for individual large files

## Why This Improvement?

- **High impact:** Memory maintenance is explicitly in focus areas
- **Small scope:** Enhancing existing script, not rewriting
- **Easy to test:** Script already works, just adding features
- **Clear value:** Helps maintain memory hygiene

## Plan

### Session 1 Tasks (Planning & Setup)
- [x] Analyze current memory-stats.sh
- [x] Identify enhancement opportunities
- [ ] Add "archival recommendations" feature
- [ ] Add "large file detection" feature
- [ ] Test and commit

### Session 2 Tasks (if needed)
- Add color-coded warnings for files > 30 days old
- Add JSON output for new fields
- Add --cleanup flag for automatic archival
- Update README.md

## Technical Approach

1. **Archival recommendations:**
   - Count daily files older than 30 days
   - Suggest moving to `memory/archive/` folder
   - Show disk space that could be reclaimed

2. **Large file detection:**
   - Find files > 10KB (unusually large for memory notes)
   - List them with sizes

3. **Stale research detection:**
   - Research files older than 90 days with no references

## Progress

### 7:00 PM - Started session
- Scanned workspace
- Identified memory-stats.sh as target
- Created this plan

### 7:10 PM - Implementation
- Added archival recommendations feature:
  - Detects daily files older than 30 days
  - Shows count, reclaimable size, and oldest candidates
  - Suggests moving to memory/archive/
- Added large file detection:
  - Finds .md files over 10KB
  - Lists them with sizes
  - Suggests splitting or summarizing
- Updated both JSON and human-readable outputs
- Tested successfully ✓

## Results

**Before:** memory-stats.sh showed basic counts only
**After:** Now includes:
- 📦 Archival Recommendations (30+ day old files)
- 📏 Large Files (>10KB warnings)
- JSON output includes new fields for automation

**Test output:**
```
📦 Archival Recommendations
   No files older than 30 days ✓

📏 Large Files
   1 files over 10KB:
     • 2026-02-01-pihole-advanced-features.md (10KB)
   Tip: Consider splitting or summarizing large files
```

## Next Steps (Session 2)
- [ ] Update scripts/README.md with new features
- [ ] Add --cleanup flag for automatic archival
- [ ] Consider adding --fix flag to auto-split large files
