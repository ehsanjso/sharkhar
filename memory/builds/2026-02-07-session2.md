# Proactive Coder - Session 2 (Feb 7, 2026)

## Session Info
- **Start:** 11:00 PM EST
- **Model:** Opus (cron)
- **Duration:** ~10 minutes
- **Goal:** Execution & Completion

## Continuing from Session 1

Session 1 enhanced memory-stats.sh with:
- Archival recommendations (detect files >30 days)
- Large file detection (files >10KB)
- JSON output for both new fields

## Session 2 Work

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Update scripts/README.md with new features
- [x] Add `--cleanup` flag for automatic archival
- [x] Test all modes (default, --json, --cleanup)
- [x] Commit changes

### --cleanup Feature Implementation
Added auto-archival capability:
```bash
./memory-stats.sh --cleanup   # Moves files >30 days to memory/archive/
```

Features:
- Creates `memory/archive/` if needed
- Lists each file as it's moved
- Shows total space saved
- Graceful message if nothing to archive

### Test Results
```
✓ No files to archive (nothing older than 30 days)
```
(Currently no files old enough to archive - working as expected)

## Commit
```
8646eb9c feat(memory-stats): add --cleanup flag for auto-archival
```

## Status: ✅ Complete

All Session 1 planned work is now finished:
1. ✅ Archival recommendations
2. ✅ Large file detection
3. ✅ README documentation
4. ✅ --cleanup auto-archive flag

## Possible Future Enhancements
- `--fix` flag to auto-split large files (more complex, needs AI summarization)
- Color-coded age warnings in file listings
- Integration with status.sh for unified view
