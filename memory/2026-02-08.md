## 12:00 PM — Spare Capacity: Memory Maintenance

**Quotas:** Session 2%, Weekly 5%, Sonnet 7% (all healthy)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed daily files from Feb 5-7
- Updated MEMORY.md with important learnings:
  - Added Social Media Trend Monitoring section (Last30Days skill, PRAW, xAI, search API gap)
  - Added investor-tracker indentation bug fix to recent code improvements
  - Updated timestamp to Feb 8
- Created today's daily file
- Commit: `fa2fa746`

## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: RAG for Personal Knowledge Base

**Topic selected:** Building local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for semantic search over memory files

**Why this topic:**
- Mission Control shows memories but can't search them semantically
- 70+ memory files growing — need better way to surface context
- ClawdBot's memory_search is disabled (no OpenAI/Google keys)
- Natural extension of Ollama research (Feb 4) — local embeddings now viable
- Complete the self-hosted AI stack: Pi-hole → Ollama → RAG → Mission Control

**Key discoveries:**
1. **nomic-embed-text** — Best embedding model for Pi 5 (274MB, 768 dims, ~50 docs/min)
2. **LanceDB** — Ideal vector DB (serverless, no daemon, ~50MB RAM, just pip install)
3. **Chunking strategy** — Split by H2 headers, keep file metadata attached
4. **Implementation path** — Can have working RAG in 1-2 hours
5. **Cost savings** — ~$30-50/month vs cloud embeddings + vector DB

**Tech stack for Pi 5:**
```
Ollama
├── nomic-embed-text (embeddings, 274MB)
└── llama3.2:1b (generation, 1.3GB)

LanceDB (pip install lancedb)
└── Stores vectors as Parquet files
    └── No background daemon needed!
```

**Practical applications:**
- "What did I work on last week?" → Retrieves relevant daily files
- "What do I know about Home Assistant?" → Finds Feb 3 research
- Mission Control search bar that actually works semantically
- Could enable local `memory_search` for ClawdBot

**Next steps:**
1. Install nomic-embed-text: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
2. Create minimal indexer script with LanceDB
3. Test with queries about past work
4. Consider adding to Mission Control as search API
