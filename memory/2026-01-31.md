## Summary
Set up Uptime Kuma for monitoring all services on the Raspberry Pi.

## What We Built

### Uptime Kuma Setup
- Installed and configured Uptime Kuma (service monitoring tool)
- Fixed database migration issues (had to manually copy migration files)
- Created admin account and set up 9 monitors
- All services are being monitored and showing as UP

**Monitors configured:**
1. Pi-hole Web Interface (HTTP on port 80)
2. Pi-hole DNS Port (port 53 check)
3. ClawdBot Web (Mission Control on port 3000)
4. SSH Service (port 22)
5. Raspberry Pi 5 (ping check)
6. Uptime Kuma (self-monitoring on port 3001)
7. Router/Gateway (192.168.0.1 ping)
8. Internet Connectivity (8.8.8.8 ping to Google DNS)
9. External Web Access (HTTPS check to google.com)

**Access:**
- URL: http://192.168.0.217:3001
- Username: admin
- Password: clawd2026!

### Technical Details
- Had to install `uptime-kuma-api` Python package for CLI management
- Used the uptime-kuma skill script at `/home/ehsanjso/clawd/skills/uptime-kuma/scripts/kuma.py`
- Removed HTTPS monitor for Pi-hole (self-signed cert was causing failures)

### Services Running
- **Port 3000**: Mission Control (Next.js second brain app)
- **Port 3001**: Uptime Kuma (monitoring)
- **Port 80/443**: Pi-hole web interface
- **Port 53**: Pi-hole DNS
- **Port 22**: SSH

## Memory Management Discussion
Ehsan asked if I store things in memory and if I use Mission Control. Yes to both:

**Memory Storage:**
- MEMORY.md - Long-term curated knowledge
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md - Daily logs (like this one)
- Updated MEMORY.md with Uptime Kuma details
- Fixed Mission Control port (was listed as 3456, actually 3000)

**Mission Control Usage:**
I should be using Mission Control more actively. It's my second brain app that:
- Shows all documents from memory/ folder
- Has task management
- Displays daily journals
- Accessible at http://192.168.0.217:3000

## Docker Installation
After discovering SQL bugs in the npm version (2.0.0-dev.0), we switched to Docker:
- Installed Docker 29.2.0 on Raspberry Pi
- Running Uptime Kuma in container (stable version)
- Removed npm installation and old data
- All 9 monitors re-added and working perfectly

## Lessons
- When npm package has missing files, check if they exist elsewhere in the package and copy them
- Simple port checks work better than DNS checks for monitoring
- Always document access credentials in MEMORY.md
- Keep memory files updated - they're my continuity between sessions
- Docker is better for services like Uptime Kuma - more stable, easier to manage, auto-restart built-in
- Development versions (2.0.0-dev.0) can have critical bugs - use stable releases in production
