## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: MCP Servers Ecosystem

**Topic selected:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and integration

**Why this topic:**
- Ehsan has mcporter skill available but may not be fully utilizing it
- MCP ecosystem is exploding — 100s of servers for everything
- Direct relevance to ClawdBot (can enhance with MCP integrations)
- Fits self-hosted infrastructure goals (Pi-hole, Home Assistant, etc.)

**Key discoveries:**
1. **MCP = "USB-C for AI"** — Standardized protocol for AI tool access
2. **mcporter already installed** at `/home/ehsanjso/.npm-global/bin/mcporter`
3. **10+ language SDKs** — Can build custom servers in Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.
4. **Reference servers:** Filesystem, Git, Memory, Fetch, Time, Sequential Thinking
5. **Community ecosystem:** 100s of servers on awesome-mcp-servers list
6. **Relevant integrations:** Home Assistant, Linear, GitHub, SQLite, Notion
7. **Aggregators exist:** Pipedream MCP gives access to 2,500+ APIs at once

**Practical applications for Ehsan:**
- Home Assistant control via MCP
- SQLite database queries via chat
- Enhanced Git operations for workspace
- Pipedream for massive API access

**Quick wins to try:**
- `mcporter list` — check current config
- Home Assistant MCP server
- Filesystem MCP for safer file ops
