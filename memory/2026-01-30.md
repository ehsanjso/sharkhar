# 2026-01-30 — Thursday

## 08:00 PM — Session Started

**What happened:** Ehsan started a new session to set up Mission Control following Alex Finn's video recommendations.

**Key context:**
- Video: "5 insane ClawdBot uses cases you need to do immediately"
- Goal: Build a Second Brain app matching the video's design
- Platform: Raspberry Pi 5 running ClawdBot

---

## 08:15 PM — Mission Control App Created

**What we built:**
- Next.js app with Tailwind CSS
- Document viewer reading from `memory/` folder
- Sidebar with document list and type filters
- Markdown rendering with GFM support

**Location:** `/home/ehsanjso/clawd/mission-control`

---

## 08:45 PM — Task Board Added

**What we did:** Added `/tasks` route to track project progress visually.

**Current tasks remaining:**
- Morning Brief (8am cron)
- Daily Research Report (afternoon)
- Last30Days Skill installation
- Proactive Coder (11pm builds)

---

## 09:00 PM — UI Matched to Video

**What happened:** Got screenshot from Alex Finn's video at 6:40 mark showing the actual Mission Control UI.

**Changes made:**
- Navy blue theme (not pure black)
- Header with Tasks/Docs/People tabs
- "Pause" and "Ping Henry" buttons
- Sidebar filters: Journal, Other, Content, Newsletters
- Document list with colored type tags inline
- Date format: "2026-01-30 — Friday"
- Input bar at bottom with Debug, message input, New session, Send

## Key Learnings

1. **Mission Control is MY tool** — I should use it to track our work, not just build it
2. **Memory folder = my brain** — All my notes, journals, and memories go here
3. **Daily journals** — Create entries like this one to record what we discuss
4. **Important concepts → separate docs** — Flesh out ideas in their own documents

---

## 10:00 PM — UI Upgraded to shadcn/ui

**What we did:**
- Initialized shadcn/ui with Zinc color theme
- Added components: Card, Button, Input, Badge, Tabs, ScrollArea, Separator
- Rewrote main page and tasks page with consistent shadcn components
- GitHub-inspired dark navy theme
- Cleaner, more polished visual design

**Duncan Rogoff's 63 Use Cases Video:**
- Watched and extracted use cases from video
- Key additions to consider: Competitor Scan, Deep Research, Email Management, Social Media Replies

- [x] Keep Mission Control server running persistently (systemd service?) ✅
- [ ] Test Remotion renders on Pi (may need adjustments for ARM)
- [ ] Consider: Competitor/Trend Scanning, Email Management
