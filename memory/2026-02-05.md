## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Reverse Proxy for Homelab

**Topic selected:** Setting up a reverse proxy to unify all self-hosted services with clean URLs

**Why this topic:**
- Natural progression from Pi-hole local DNS research (Feb 1)
- Ehsan accesses 5+ services by IP:port — a proxy gives clean `*.home` URLs
- Connects to every project: Mission Control, Uptime Kuma, Pi-hole, ClawdBot
- Pi-hole already provides the DNS layer — just needs a routing layer on top

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Caddy is the winner** for Pi 5 — single binary, ~40MB RAM, dead-simple Caddyfile
2. **Native Raspbian packages** — `apt install caddy` works out of the box
3. **`tls internal`** — Auto-generates self-signed certs for LAN domains (no Let's Encrypt needed)
4. **Port 80 conflict** with Pi-hole solvable by moving lighttpd to port 8080
5. **Pi-hole + Caddy combo** — DNS resolves `*.home` to Pi, Caddy routes by hostname to correct port
6. **~35 minute setup** from zero to clean URLs for all services

**Compared alternatives:**
- Nginx Proxy Manager: Nice GUI but needs Docker, port conflicts, heavier
- Traefik: Overkill for 5-6 services, steep learning curve

**Quick setup plan:**
1. Install Caddy via apt
2. Move Pi-hole off port 80
3. Write Caddyfile with reverse_proxy for each service
4. Add local DNS records in Pi-hole
5. Done — `mission.home`, `uptime.home`, `pihole.home`
