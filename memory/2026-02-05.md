## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Reverse Proxy for Homelab

**Topic selected:** Setting up a reverse proxy to unify all self-hosted services with clean URLs

**Why this topic:**
- Natural progression from Pi-hole local DNS research (Feb 1)
- Ehsan accesses 5+ services by IP:port — a proxy gives clean `*.home` URLs
- Connects to every project: Mission Control, Uptime Kuma, Pi-hole, ClawdBot
- Pi-hole already provides the DNS layer — just needs a routing layer on top

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Caddy is the winner** for Pi 5 — single binary, ~40MB RAM, dead-simple Caddyfile
2. **Native Raspbian packages** — `apt install caddy` works out of the box
3. **`tls internal`** — Auto-generates self-signed certs for LAN domains (no Let's Encrypt needed)
4. **Port 80 conflict** with Pi-hole solvable by moving lighttpd to port 8080
5. **Pi-hole + Caddy combo** — DNS resolves `*.home` to Pi, Caddy routes by hostname to correct port
6. **~35 minute setup** from zero to clean URLs for all services

**Compared alternatives:**
- Nginx Proxy Manager: Nice GUI but needs Docker, port conflicts, heavier
- Traefik: Overkill for 5-6 services, steep learning curve

**Quick setup plan:**
1. Install Caddy via apt
2. Move Pi-hole off port 80
3. Write Caddyfile with reverse_proxy for each service
4. Add local DNS records in Pi-hole
5. Done — `mission.home`, `uptime.home`, `pihole.home`

## Mobbin Design Research Pipeline
- Built a best-of-breed design research pipeline using Mobbin
- Takes a URL/description → analyzes product → finds best flows from multiple apps → downloads → packages with PROMPT.md
- First test: Bayclaw (bayclaw.com) — hosted AI assistant platform
  - Linear (4.75★) for UI/design language + onboarding (25 screens)
  - Perplexity (5.0★) for AI chat interface (7 screens) + billing (9 screens)
  - Shopify for dashboard (10 screens)
- Total: 51 screens across 3 apps with a ready-to-use prompt for AI design agents
- Key insight: Mobbin organizes by flows (sequential screens from one app), but the power is mixing best flows from *different* apps
- Ehsan's vision: analyze sentiment from Reddit/web to pick which flows are praised, then combine with best UI. Web research API (Tavily/Exa) not configured yet — used knowledge-based recommendations instead

## 07:00 PM — Proactive Coder Session 1

**Task:** Add CPU throttling detection to pi-health.sh

**Problem discovered:** Pi running at 84.2°C with active thermal throttling (0xe0008)
- Soft temperature limit active NOW
- ARM freq capping + throttling have occurred since boot
- This was invisible before the enhancement!

**Changes made:**
- Decode all 8 vcgencmd throttle bits (current + historical)
- Add ⚡ Throttling section to text output
- Add throttling object to JSON output
- Count active throttling in issue summary
- Update README documentation

**Commit:** `5e64c3de`

**Session 2 recommendation:** Add CPU frequency monitoring to show throttle impact (e.g., "Running at 75% speed")
