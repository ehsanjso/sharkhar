# 2026-02-15 - Polymarket Multi-Strategy Bot V2

## Major Work: Polymarket BTC 15-min Trading Bot

### V1 Strategies - FAILED HARD 💀
Built 10 strategies, most got crushed in 3 markets:
- **Early Bird**: Wiped out ($0) - 0W/3L
- **Trend Follower**, **Late Entry**, **VAM**: Nearly wiped out
- **Problem**: All bet WITH early momentum, but BTC mean-reverted every time

### Key Research Findings
- **Only 12.7% of Polymarket wallets are profitable**
- "If you're betting on gut feelings, you're exiting liquidity for algorithmic traders"
- BTC 15-min markets are designed for HFT, not retail prediction
- **Mean reversion dominates** short-term crypto moves
- Early momentum is a TRAP - pros fade retail moves

### V1 Winners (kept for V2)
- **Kelly Fractional**: $100 → stayed at $100 (correctly didn't bet)
- **EV Maximizer**: $100 → $90 (correctly skipped most markets)
- **Regime Detection**: $100 → $57, 2W/1L (ONLY profitable strategy!)

### V2 Strategies Implemented (Anti-Retail)
1. **Fade the Move** - Bets AGAINST >0.12% moves after min 5
2. **Stoikov Spread** - Academic market-making, risk-adjusted sizing
3. **Bayesian Updater** - Only bets when >65% posterior confidence
4. **Time-Decay Reversal** - Ignores first 8 min, fades late extremes
5. **Breakout Confirmation** - Only bets on confirmed trends (>70% retained)
6. Kelly Fractional (kept)
7. Regime Detection (kept - was only winner!)
8. EV Maximizer (kept)
9. **Ultra Conservative** - Waits until min 12, tiny bets
10. **Random Baseline** - 50/50 coin flip control group

### Dashboard & Reports
- Dashboard: http://192.168.0.217:8084
- **8 PM EST**: Give quick bot status update
- **12 AM EST (Midnight)**: Detailed report - which strategies work best per market, best combo to fund for profit
- All strategies reset to $100 each per market

### Multi-Market Expansion (Evening)
Expanded from BTC-only to 6 markets:
- BTC 15min, BTC 5min
- ETH 15min, ETH 5min
- SOL 15min, SOL 5min

Each market runs 16 strategies × $100 = $1,600 per market = $9,600 total paper trading

### Control Features Added
- **Global STOP ALL** button on main page
- **Per-market halt/resume** button
- **Per-strategy halt** with stop loss auto-halt at $25
- **Paper vs Live mode** toggle (visual indicators: 📄 Paper / 💰 LIVE)
- **Active bids panel** on main page showing current bets across all markets

### Current Status (as of evening)
- BTC-5min: +$353 (doing well!)
- ETH-5min: +$576 (best performer!)
- BTC-15min: -$193 (struggling)
- ETH-15min: -$79
- SOL markets: just started

## Key Lesson
**Don't bet WITH early momentum in short-term BTC markets. The pros fade retail moves. Mean reversion > momentum for 15-min windows.**
