Quick scan of recent AI/ML papers during spare capacity work.

## Notable Papers

### 1. PULSE: Communication-Efficient Distributed RL
- **Authors:** Erfan Miahi, Eugene Belilovsky
- **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03839
- **Summary:** Weight-update sparsity in RL exceeds 99% across settings. PULSE achieves 100x compression (14GB → 108MB) for weight sync in distributed LLM training. Enables decentralized RL to match centralized throughput.
- **Relevance:** Useful for anyone running distributed fine-tuning. Could reduce bandwidth needs significantly.

### 2. Accelerating Scientific Research with Gemini
- **Authors:** Woodruff et al. (Google, various universities)
- **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03837
- **Summary:** Case studies of Gemini Deep Think solving open math problems, refuting conjectures, generating proofs. Techniques include iterative refinement, neuro-symbolic loops with code execution.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates frontier model capabilities for research collaboration. "AI as genuine partner in discovery."

### 3. AutoFigure: Scientific Illustration Generation
- **Authors:** Zhu et al.
- **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03828
- **Summary:** Agentic framework for generating publication-ready scientific figures from text. FigureBench contains 3,300 text-figure pairs. **Accepted at ICLR 2026.**
- **Relevance:** Could be useful for automating diagram/figure generation. Worth trying for papers/docs.

### 4. Conformal Thinking: Risk Control for Reasoning
- **Authors:** Xi Wang, Anushri Suresh
- **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03814
- **Summary:** Framework for adaptive reasoning - stop early when confident, detect unsolvable problems preemptively. Uses distribution-free risk control.
- **Relevance:** Relevant for optimizing token usage in reasoning models. Trade-off between compute and accuracy.
