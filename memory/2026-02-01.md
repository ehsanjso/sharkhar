## Claude Quota Monitor Setup
- Logged into claude.ai using clawd browser profile (magic link via ehsan.jsoure@gmail.com)
- Session persists for future automated checks
- Created cron job "Claude Quota Monitor" running at 9am, 3pm, 9pm daily
- Goal: pace usage to hit 80% at each reset window
  - Session resets ~every 5 hours
  - Weekly All Models resets Thursday 10:59 PM
  - Weekly Sonnet resets Saturday 4:59 PM
- Current status at setup: Session 24%, Weekly All 15%, Sonnet 7%

## Mission Control Expansion - Agent Dashboard

Built new pages for Mission Control based on Alex Finn's video tip about building your own tooling:

### New Pages Created:
1. **Agent Dashboard** (`/agent`) - My context recovery center
   - Claude quota status (reads from quota-cache.json)
   - Cron jobs summary with success/failure counts
   - Recent activity feed (commits, memory updates, cron runs)
   - Quick stats (memory files, active projects)

2. **Cron Jobs** (`/crons`) - Detailed scheduled job viewer
   - Summary cards (total, active, paused, failed)
   - Full job list with schedules, timings, durations
   - Error display for failed jobs

### How It Helps Me:
- Every session I wake up fresh - this dashboard shows me what happened while I was "asleep"
- I can quickly see which cron jobs failed and need attention
- Recent activity shows commits and memory changes
- Quota info helps me pace usage

### Technical Details:
- API endpoint `/api/agent-context` fetches live data from gateway
- Quota data cached in `memory/quota-cache.json` (updated by quota monitor cron)
- Uses existing shadcn/ui components

## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Advanced Pi-hole Features

**Topic selected:** Advanced Pi-hole automation, CLI, API, and integration capabilities

**Why this topic:**
- Ehsan has Pi-hole running but may only be using basic features
- Fits his interest in automation and self-hosted infrastructure
- Natural integration point with Mission Control, Uptime Kuma, and ClawdBot
- Can add Pi-hole control to ClawdBot skills

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Powerful CLI** - Full control via `pihole` command (allow/deny, query, status, etc.)
2. **REST API** - Modern API at `http://pi.hole/api/` for programmatic access
3. **Regex filtering** - Block thousands of domains with single patterns
4. **Community regex lists** - mmotti/pihole-regex adds powerful pattern-based blocking
5. **Local DNS records** - Create custom `.local` domains for services (mission-control.local, etc.)
6. **DHCP server mode** - Pi-hole can replace router DHCP for automatic DNS assignment
7. **Integration opportunities** - Can integrate with Mission Control, Uptime Kuma, Home Assistant

**Practical next steps:**
- Add mmotti regex filters for broader blocking
- Set up local DNS records (mission-control.local, uptime.local, pi.local)
- Test API for Mission Control integration
- Build Pi-hole stats page in Mission Control
- Consider creating ClawdBot Pi-hole skill
