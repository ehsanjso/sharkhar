# 2026-02-18 - Polymarket Bot V3 Goes Live

## Major Accomplishments

### Bot Fixes & Features Added
1. **Window Detection Fix** - Changed from `get_next_5min_window()` to `get_current_5min_window()` - was detecting windows late
2. **Unicode Crash Fix** - Replaced ✓ ✗ → with ASCII (WIN, LOSS, ->) - PM2 runs with latin-1 encoding
3. **Market Orders** - Switched from limit orders (sat unfilled) to FOK market orders via `execute_market_buy()` - orders now fill instantly
4. **No Hedging** - Added `current_window_side` tracking to prevent betting both UP and DOWN in same window
5. **Balance Protection** - Added pre-bet check: `balance - BET_AMOUNT >= MIN_BALANCE`
6. **Position Tracking** - Added `get_live_positions()` and `check_and_report_positions()` for live mode
7. **Auto-Redemption** - Added `auto_redeem_positions()` that triggers on window change - VERIFIED WORKING!

### Key Code Locations

- Added by Ehsan: +$5.00

### Key Learnings
1. Polymarket BTC 5-min markets have thin liquidity - need aggressive pricing
2. Polymarket does NOT auto-redeem - must call redeem contract manually
3. FOK (Fill or Kill) orders work better than GTC limit orders
4. Position resolution takes 5-10 mins after window close

### Wallet
- Address: `0x923C9c79ADF737A878f6fFb4946D7da889d78E1d`
- Running via PM2: `pm2 restart btc-agent`

## Status
Bot is LIVE and fully automated:
- Places bets with market orders
- Tracks pending positions  
- Auto-redeems winnings on window change
- Ehsan verified auto-redeem working at 1:50 PM EST
