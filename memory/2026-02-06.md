## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Raspberry Pi 5 Thermal Management

**Topic selected:** Cooling and thermal optimization for Pi 5

**Why this topic:**
- Yesterday discovered active throttling at 84.2°C (flags 0xe0008)
- This affects all services: ClawdBot, Uptime Kuma, Mission Control, etc.
- Throttling means reduced performance across the board
- Urgent, actionable, and directly impacts infrastructure

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Pi 5 runs HOT** — 80°C+ under load without cooling, throttles at 80°C/85°C
2. **Official Active Cooler is $5** — Best bang for buck, drops temps 25-30°C
3. **PWM fan control** — Adjustable via `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
4. **ICE Tower for heavy loads** — Best performance if running Ollama/overclocking
5. **Throttle flags decoded** — 0xe0008 = soft limit + freq capping + historical throttling

**Immediate recommendations:**
- Check if Active Cooler is installed
- Order $5 Active Cooler if missing
- Add thermal monitoring to heartbeat/Uptime Kuma
- Position Pi for better airflow while waiting
