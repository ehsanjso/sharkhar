## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Raspberry Pi 5 Thermal Management

**Topic selected:** Cooling and thermal optimization for Pi 5

**Why this topic:**
- Yesterday discovered active throttling at 84.2°C (flags 0xe0008)
- This affects all services: ClawdBot, Uptime Kuma, Mission Control, etc.
- Throttling means reduced performance across the board
- Urgent, actionable, and directly impacts infrastructure

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Pi 5 runs HOT** — 80°C+ under load without cooling, throttles at 80°C/85°C
2. **Official Active Cooler is $5** — Best bang for buck, drops temps 25-30°C
3. **PWM fan control** — Adjustable via `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
4. **ICE Tower for heavy loads** — Best performance if running Ollama/overclocking
5. **Throttle flags decoded** — 0xe0008 = soft limit + freq capping + historical throttling

**Immediate recommendations:**
- Check if Active Cooler is installed
- Order $5 Active Cooler if missing
- Add thermal monitoring to heartbeat/Uptime Kuma
- Position Pi for better airflow while waiting

## 06:00 PM — Spare Capacity: Memory Maintenance

**Quotas:** Session 16%, Weekly 4%, Sonnet 7% (all healthy)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed daily files from Feb 5-6
- Updated MEMORY.md with important learnings:
  - Added ⚠️ Active Issues section for Pi 5 thermal throttling (84°C)
  - Added Caddy reverse proxy research to Integration Opportunities
  - Added Mobbin design pipeline to new Design Research Tools section
  - Updated code improvements with pi-health.sh throttle enhancement
  - Updated timestamp to Feb 6
- Commit: `8b882ba7`

**Key finding:** The thermal throttling issue discovered yesterday is now documented in long-term memory. This is critical since it affects all Pi services and has a simple $5 fix.
