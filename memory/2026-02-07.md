## Spare Capacity Work (12:00 PM)
- Quota check: all limits under 10% - proceeded with proactive work
- Reviewed polymarket-bot/scanner.py - well-written, good retry logic
- Found and fixed bug in investor-tracker/fetchers.py:
  - `fetch_13f_summary()` had indentation bug where 13F processing only ran in fallback case
  - Fixed so it runs for both rate_limiter and fallback paths
  - Committed: f2f087a7

## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: Social Media Trend Monitoring

**Topic selected:** Social media trend monitoring and the Last30Days skill

**Why this topic:**
- Explicitly mentioned in MEMORY.md as "Use Case to Implement"
- Natural fit for Daily Research cron (meta: researching how to improve research!)
- Connects to investor-tracker work (social sentiment signals)
- Gap in current tooling — no web search APIs configured (Brave, Tavily, Exa all missing keys)

**Key discoveries:**
1. **Last30Days skill** — Claude Code skill that searches Reddit + X + web, synthesizes with engagement weighting
2. **Requires two APIs:** OpenAI (for Reddit web_search) + xAI (for X search)
3. **Works without keys** but loses engagement metrics (upvotes/likes)
4. **Judge Agent pattern** — Weights Reddit/X higher than web due to engagement signals
5. **Query types:** RECOMMENDATIONS, PROMPTING, NEWS, GENERAL

**Alternative approaches:**
- **PRAW** — Free Python Reddit API (100 queries/min)
- **xAI API** — $5 free credits for X search
- **Tavily/Exa** — AI-optimized web search as fallback

**Practical applications:**
- Investor sentiment from r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks
- AI/tech trend monitoring for staying current
- Product research before building features
- Integration with polymarket-bot for market signals

**Next steps:**
1. Install Last30Days skill to ~/clawd/skills/last30days
2. Get xAI API key (free $5 credits)
3. Configure one search API (Tavily/Brave/Exa) for general research
4. Explore adding social sentiment to investor-tracker
