- Checked quota: all very low (2-3%), proceeded with proactive work
- Web search unavailable (no Brave API key, Tavily not configured)
- Added 'status' command to investor-tracker for monitoring cache health

## 02:00 PM — Daily Research: React Native New Architecture

**Topic selected:** React Native New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules)

**Why this topic:**
- Komod AI is actively developed with Expo/React Native
- Feb 12 work included animations and PWA support — understanding the underlying architecture matters
- SDK 55+ makes New Architecture mandatory — no opt-out possible
- Directly applicable to mobile app performance optimization

**Key discoveries:**
1. **JSI replaces bridge** — Direct memory refs, no serialization overhead
2. **iOS sees 15-40% faster rendering** (View Flattening now cross-platform)
3. **SDK 55+ always uses New Arch** — can't disable anymore
4. **83% of Expo apps** already on New Architecture (Jan 2026)
5. **React 18 works properly** — Suspense, Transitions, useLayoutEffect all functional

**Performance benchmarks (official):**
- 5000 Views: 39% faster on iOS
- 5000 Text: 20% faster on iOS  
- Android gains smaller (3-4%) but still positive

**Practical patterns for Komod AI:**
- `useLayoutEffect` for synchronous measurements (tooltips, popovers)
- `startTransition` for interruptible renders (filter changes, search)
- TurboModules for future native ML/camera features

**What's enabled:**
- Concurrent rendering (UI stays responsive during heavy updates)
- Synchronous layout (no visual jumps)
- Reanimated 4 will integrate directly with Fabric renderer
