# Artifacts Directory

Temporary output files generated by ClawdBot and skills. This directory is **gitignored** to keep the repo clean.

## What Goes Here

- Generated zip files (design exports, project bundles)
- PDF reports
- Audio/video outputs (TTS, clips)
- Temporary downloads
- Build outputs that don't belong in projects

## Conventions

1. **Use descriptive names**: `2026-02-15-design-export.zip` not `output.zip`
2. **Date prefix recommended**: Makes cleanup easier
3. **Delete after use**: This isn't long-term storage
4. **Send to user, then clean up**: Generate → Send to Telegram → Delete

## Auto-Cleanup

Files older than 7 days may be automatically deleted by the `prune-artifacts` cron job (if configured).

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Generate something
zip ~/clawd/artifacts/2026-02-15-component-kit.zip -r ./components

# Send to user (ClawdBot handles this)
# Then delete
rm ~/clawd/artifacts/2026-02-15-component-kit.zip
```

## Skills That Generate Artifacts

- `frontend-design` - Component exports
- `excalidraw-flowchart` - Diagram files
- `video-frames` - Frame extracts
- `pollinations` - Generated images
- `youtube-summarizer` - Transcript downloads
