### Mission Control (Second Brain)

My second brain app for viewing and organizing memories, journals, and documents.

**What it does:**
- Shows all documents from `memory/` folder
- Daily journal entries tracking our conversations
- Filter by type: Journal, Content, Newsletters, Other
- Markdown viewer with nice formatting
- Input bar for sending messages (UI ready)

**Access:**
- App: http://192.168.0.217:3456
- Tasks: http://192.168.0.217:3456/tasks

**How I use it:**
1. Create daily journal entries in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Flesh out important concepts in separate docs
3. Review past conversations to maintain context
4. Track tasks and progress visually

## Lessons Learned

- **Mission Control is MY tool** — Use it actively, not just build it
- **Memory = continuity** — Write everything down, mental notes don't survive sessions
- **Match the reference** — When building from a video, get actual screenshots
- **Task board = visibility** — Helps both of us track progress
